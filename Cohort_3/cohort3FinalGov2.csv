11/14/2023 11:47:45,"Detroit, MI",Strongly agree,Agree,Agree,Agree,"One of my major takeaways from conducting my research was that there is a need for clear communication on the processes and plans that happen in Detroit between city leaders when engaging with residents and advocates. Interviewees described many scenarios where they wanted more transparency from city leaders whether that be in the budgeting process, project plan timeline and updates,etc. From these interviews, I understood that more genuine collaboration involving all stakeholders was needed and that can indeed help establish and grow the trust between such stakeholders. 
",Agree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Disagree,Agree,Agree,Disagree,"I represent the community organization in this project, however I can speak on working with the external groups such as the Detroit city leaders. This project has led the way to working with the city team in the future perhaps but overall I have learned that it can be complicated working with different external partners. However there’s something to be learned from each representative group and to have successful collaboration it’s important to focus on the vision of the project and pay attention to how each person contributes a certain expertise and knowledge. These insights are helpful as we continue to try to collaborate with different external stakeholders. ","As the community partner, we did not work with other internal agencies, however this experience has made me aware of the constant need to make sure our own internal teams have an aligned vision as we work together.",Agree,Agree,I think having the community partner in the initial meeting with the city to discuss the problem statement could have been ideal. This would've helped flesh out the problem statement especially because the community partner may have different insight on what issues residents are facing.  ,"I found having the facilitator/spring conductor from CPI to be extremely helpful. Tahmid helped keep us on track, increase room for collaboration and brought valuable insight to the sprint. We couldn't have came this far in the project without him! Additionally, I also found it helpful that other teams in different states were doing this work at the same time as us. It was great to see what others were doing and how they were creating creative resident centered solutions. ","I appreciate the idea of a ""sprint"" and getting things done on a timeline, however this made the project even more difficult at times. There was not much room for setbacks and this often created pressure within the team.
