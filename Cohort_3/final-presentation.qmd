## **Overview**

**What is this?**

This report presents insights into the learning outcomes of Cohort 3 participants in The Opportunity Project for Cities (TOPC) in 2023. It also evaluates the program's effectiveness in improving participants':

1.  Awareness and knowledge.

2.  Competencies and confidence (self-efficacy).

3.  Recognition and application of methods.

4.  Intention to action and overall satisfaction.

## Finding

In general, there is a positive improvement in terms of competence and confidence (i.e. self efficacy of skills) towards community research. However, these results are not reflective of the general population, i.e. of all participants in the TOPC program.

## Limitations

-   **The survey design had issues.** We relied on descriptive data and interviews to find trends and themes. Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses also provided some insights into changes in participants' experiences and perceptions.

-   **The survey was not distributed to all program participants**. This could have biased sample size and results. We corrected this challenge by calculating and defining survey design weights.

-   **In the post-test data, there was a PSU of one**, which means we cannot calculate the variance. There were other methods to correct this such as using bootstrapping or jacknife, but these methods are time consuming and can't justify the need for it.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   The pre-test and post-test survey questions are conceptually aligned but not directly comparable in terms of measurement scales and language of questions. The pre-test uses a 4-point Likert scale focused on agreement, while the post-test uses a 5-point scale assessing expertise levels. This difference in scales means a direct comparison or change analysis (like a t-test) is not straightforward.

-   However, **both sets of questions target similar skills and experiences.** To assess changes, we looked at shifts in distribution of responses, using non-parametric methods or descriptive statistics to compare before and after without inferring statistical significance based on the Likert scale points.

-   In our analysis of the survey data, we have applied survey sampling weights to adjust for disparities in response rates and representation across different city government groups. While these weights help in making our sample more reflective of the broader population, it's important to note that they cannot entirely compensate for all the limitations inherent in the data. Specifically, the non-random nature of our sampling method and the presence of biases in sample collection present challenges that weights alone may not fully address. As a result, while the weighted analysis offers valuable insights, the findings should be interpreted with an understanding of these constraints. We remain committed to transparency and rigor in our research and want to ensure that all stakeholders are aware of the nuances and limitations of the methods employed.
