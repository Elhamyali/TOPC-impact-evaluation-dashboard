## Methodology 

## Limitations 

There were a few key challenges

The pre-test and post-test survey questions are conceptually aligned but not directly comparable in terms of measurement scales and language of questions.
The pre-test uses a 4-point Likert scale focused on agreement, while the post-test uses a 5-point scale assessing expertise levels. This difference in scales means a direct comparison or change analysis (like a t-test) is not straightforward.
However, both sets of questions target similar skills and experiences.
To assess changes, I looked at shifts in distribution of responses, using non-parametric methods or descriptive statistics to compare before and after without inferring statistical significance based on the Likert scale points.
Qualitative analysis of open-ended responses also provided some insights into changes in participants' experiences and perceptions.
